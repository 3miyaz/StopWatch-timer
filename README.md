# This is a simple stopWatch timer implemented using reactJs

The timer has four buttons: 'START', 'STOP', 'RESUME' and 'RESET'.

1. When the timer has not started yet, we have 'START' button.

3. When the timer is running, we have two buttons: 1. 'STOP', which stops the timer and 2. 'RESET', which resets the timer to initial state.

5. When the timer is stopped, we have two buttons, 1. 'RESUME', to continue the timer, and 2. 'RESET', which resets the timer to initial state.
